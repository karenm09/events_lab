# To-Do: Make To-Do

It's time to make our first usable frontend app. Today, we're going to construct a to-do list. Our app will have the following items:

- An `h1` title (e.g. "Reed's To-Dos").
- A single `ul` tag, empty when the page is first loaded.
- A `form` for the user to add a new to-do, with a single text `input` and a `submit` button.

And the following functionalities:

- When the user writes something in the `form`'s text input area and clicks `submit`, the `ul` should update with a new `li` item at the bottom of the list. The page **should not refresh**.
- When the user writes _nothing_ in the `form`'s text input area and clicks `submit`, an error message (inside a `p` tag) should appear below the form.
- When the user clicks on one of the `li` items, the item should be crossed out, indicating that that to-do is complete.

## Bonus Tasks

- Implement a `button` tag next to each `li` that removes that `li` tag entirely.
  - **Extra bonus**: Add validation to this button so it _only_ removes to-dos which have been crossed out. Otherwise, send an `alert` to the window with an error message.
- Add the ability to add multiple to-dos if the user submits a text input with multiple lines. Each line should be a new to-do.
- Style your app using a simple, clear aesthetic.
